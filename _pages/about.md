Welcome to Haoyuan Jiang's Personal Homepage!

Now, I am a senior algorithm engineer at Baidu Inc. Before that, i was a researcher at Sensetime. My research interest includes **Reinforcement Learning, General Agents and Embodied AI**, driven by a desire to contribute to building AGI algorithms. I was worked closely with <a href='https://bonaldli.github.io'>Prof. Ziyue Li</a> at the University of Cologne and Principal Researcher <a href='https://maohangyu.github.io'>Hangyu Mao</a> at Sensetime Research.

[//]: # (op international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> &#40;You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>&#41;)

In my experiences, I have been investigating how to enable autonomous agents to learn, make decisions in complex environments, and apply them in reality. This includes developing new reinforcement learning algorithms that allow agents to cooperate, easily adapt to new environments and meet industry requirements.

If you are interested with my experience or research. Please feel free to contact with me!

[A General Scenario-Agnostic Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10481508/)

**Haoyuan Jiang**, Ziyue Li, Zhishuai Li, Lei Bai, Hangyu Mao, Wolfgang Ketter, Rui Zhao.

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=86wzq9oAAAAJ&citation_for_view=86wzq9oAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We proposed a reinforcement learning algorithm for the traffic signal control field, which can easily cope with different scenarios and various types of intersections. Through training in large-scale scenarios, we found that the performance has been significantly improved and has strong generalization.
